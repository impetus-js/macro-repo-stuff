# macro-repo-stuff
This repo is a little project that I'm working on to prove some ideas to myself. It is primarily TypeScript but would hope, sometime in the far future, to handle multiple different langauges.

I am starting this project using this repo template: [NiGhTTraX/ts-monorepo](https://github.com/NiGhTTraX/ts-monorepo).
