The macro-repo framework is a repo framework & manager that allows for organizations to manage their platform & subdomains with their standards faster, easier and consistantly. The manager allows for faster and nearly automatic development of business rules & features. Engineers need not worry about setting up repositories nor the configuration of their code and significantly lowering the burden of managing the code. It is highly opinionated which makes static analysis, code changes, upgrades and so much more simpler and easier to work with.
