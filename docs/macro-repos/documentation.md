# Documentation
The framework would have the functionality to automatically build documentation for macrorepo code.

- Code API docs
- Web API docs
  - I'm not sure how I would do this honestly since I want it to be generated automatically and not having to write it manually into function comments or a `yaml`/`json` file.
- Storybook
- Code documentation
  - Uses `11ty`
