## Package Management
Basically how things will be run, created, injected and if a package is published or not. 

[`NOTE`] Private packages need to be compiled but are shareable within a macrorepo. Adadhering to the philosophies and standards of the framework private packages are only used ***WITHIN*** that macrorepo. If a package is to be public it could be used external to the repo. If it is public that indicates the possibility of being in the organization's shared macro-repo(s).
